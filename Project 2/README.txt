This program accepts two arguments, a text-file name and a target word.
The program searches through the file, and prints out each line that contains
a match for the target word, using fork and IPC methods.

To compile, run the following:

make project2

Or just simply 'make,' since the first rule in the makefile is the rule
to create the executable.

To run the program, run the following:

./project2 [filename] '[target word]'
