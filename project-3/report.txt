MapReduce is a method by which a program that is normally iterative can be
split between multiple threads to be processed parallel-wise, which in turn
speeds up the execution time. To perform MapReduce, we take a large data set,
split it into equal sized pieces and run our algorithm on each piece in a
thread (mapping), and then merge the results from each thread (reducing).

Tools like Hadoop are popular because they provide an easy-to-use framework to
perform MapReduce and parallel computing in general. The tool takes away the
overhead of process management from the programmer's responsibility, and lets
the programmer focus on the 'meat' of the problem they are working on. Parallel
computing allows to process large data sets much quicker than before, which is
why tools like these that make parallel computing accessible are so important.
