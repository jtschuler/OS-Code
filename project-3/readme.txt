This program accepts two arguments, a text-file name and a target word. The
program searches through the file, and prints out each line that contains a
match for the target word, using fork, shared memory, and POSIX threading.

To compile, run either of the following (as the first rule in the makefile is
the rule to create the executable):

make
make project3

To run the program, run the following:

./project3 <filename> <'target word'>
